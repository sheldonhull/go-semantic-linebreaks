[Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/)

ðŸš§ This is a work in progress.

- Used to test creating a simple linter cli using TDD.
- Doesn't have any intelligence on parsing a markdown, just raw text, so might break snippet code blocks in some language I haven't seen yet, though my initial tests for my blog worked well.
